<h2 class="row">About the Grant</h2>

<p class=row">The Ignition Grant was created by Ignite Baltimore to fund new, innovative, feasible projects that aim to
make Baltimore a better place to live and work. The intent is to inspire individuals to take action as well as spark
and reward creative ideas that address the City’s social and economic challenges. These grants are funded by proceeds from
Ignite Baltimore ticket sales.</p> <!-- and sponsored by The Warnock Foundation. -->

<p class="row">
Past grants have supported a youth-run project in Reservoir Hill that is using litter to create murals and flower gardens; supplies for low-earning women, who are using their crafting skills to generate income, so that they could sell their products at farmers' markets; interviews with people who are homeless to encourage understanding of the experience of homelessness; a filmmaking course for youth in the Walbrook neighborhood; video tours of Baltimore's parks and trails; and development of a website to showcase Baltimore’s dance community.
